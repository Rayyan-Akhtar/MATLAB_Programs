This package has four different files. The code is written to plot the uniform linear array 
beam pattern. Beam pattern depends on the spacing between the sensors, number of sensors and 
signal wavelength or frequency. Electronic steering of the beam is also considered in two files 
among them. The user will be prompted to enter the desired values of spacing between the 
sensors, number of sensors and signal wavelength. 
GUI is also provided to select the spacing between the sensors.
